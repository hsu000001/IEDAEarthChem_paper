Recent examples of papers that cite the Portal include a publication on the lithospheric evolution of the Earth from a statistical review of ~70,000 samples (Keller and Schoene, 2012), and validation of a global lithological map using ~ 290,000 data points (Hartmann and Moosdorf, 2012). Applications of the Portal in the literature have been found in many fields beyond rock and sediment chemistry; citations exist in the field of ecology (Bataille et al., 2012), water chemistry (Olson and Hawkins, 2012), and climate change (Box et al., 2011). 

Tools were developed to support investigators both as users and contributors of data. Logged-in users can save and rerun queries, which is particularly useful as new data are added to the database. A database of shared queries is stored in the Portal Glossary that can be reused by others. Samples may be selected by chemical composition in several ways, either by a numerical value (composition range of specific parameters), a classification assigned by the author, or a classification derived from the chemical composition. The difference between author-assigned and chemically-derived classifications is striking; one popular demonstration is to show that author-assigned classifications for rocks (e.g. “dacite”) span a wide range of actual classifications when their chemical composition is plotted on a TAS (total alkali versus silica) diagram (i.e. the author-given classifications are incorrect). This makes the chemically-derived classification much more accurate if the composition is very important. Figure 2 shows an example where the author assigned classification of dacite varies strongly from the chemically-derived classification.
Once samples are selected, users can access built-in visualization tools including dynamic maps and Google Earth integration. TAS and Harker plots can be generated and edited quickly. Authors with data in the portal can use the citation function to see how often data from their own publications have been downloaded. 

The Portal data results are linked with the LEPR (Library of Experimental Phase Relations) database (Hirschmann et al., 2008), allowing a comparison of field and laboratory derived rocks with matching or similar compositions. The portal can easily display sample results as grouped by a publication DOI, as used in direct linking from Science Direct online articles (Elsevier press release).
