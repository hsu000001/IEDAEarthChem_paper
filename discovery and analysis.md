# Data discovery and analysis: The EarthChem Portal

The EarthChem Portal emphasizes data discovery and analysis by searching over several federated databases, returning integrated results, and providing data analysis tools for working with the data. The Portal provides an integrated dataset from topical synthesis partner databases GEOROC, USGS, NAVDAT, PetDB and SedDB (**Figure 1**). In addition, links to relevant data in the affiliate database GANSEKI (http://www.godac.jamstec.go.jp/ganseki) are provided. The search and output procedure is similar to that from the topical databases but feature additional tools for data visualization and analysis.
