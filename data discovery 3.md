The Portal data results are linked with the LEPR (Library of Experimental Phase Relations) database \citep{Hirschmann_2008}, allowing a comparison of field and laboratory derived rocks with matching or similar compositions. The portal can easily display sample results as grouped by a publication DOI, as used in direct linking from Science Direct online articles (Elsevier press release).
